If you don't already have an HTTP server, you can install one using npm:

From the directory that contains index.html:
```
npm install -g http-server   # Or sudo npm install -g http-server
http-server                  # Creates a server at localhost:8080
```
In a browser, visit localhost:8080/index.html
